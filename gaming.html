                  Perfect support for tireless play
            </h5>
            <p>
                  Your gaming experience will be more enjoyable if you can sit and play in comfort. Gaming chairs support your entire body whether you are in an upright or reclined position. Gaming furniture is essential to prevent pain and health issues caused by long hours in a seated position. We have designed our gaming furniture with a lot of inputs from experienced gamers. A gaming chair should offer good support for the arms, neck and spine. The ergonomically designed gaming chairs keep your spine aligned and well supported. They also support and position your neck and wrists optimally. Mix and match from our selection of gaming desks and chairs or buy a pre-matched set. When you buy a gaming desk and chair as a set, you can be sure that they will work well together. Gaming in comfort helps you better focus and enjoy your game without posture or health issues.

            <h5>
                  Great support for your back
            </h5>
            <p>
                  Gaming chairs are essential for gamers who spend long hours sitting. Our gaming chairs keep your back properly aligned and prevent hunching forward. A high backrest, neck pillow and adjustable lumbar support provide the maximum back support. Adjustable lumbar support is essential to maintain the right spine curvature. You can use a neck pillow to give your neck all around support and to prevent you from holding your neck at an odd angle when playing.  Pick a neck pillow that has a skin friendly cover and can be laundered regularly.  </p>

                  Gaming chairs for smaller spaces
            </h5>
            <p>
                  Gaming chairs, by definition, are taller and more substantial than smaller office chairs. If you have a smaller space, choose a gaming chair with a mesh back. A mesh chair will provide you back support while also being visually lighter. </p>

      <div>
            <h5>
                  Choice of material
            </h5>
            <p>
                  Gaming chairs are available in a choice of leather-like and mesh finishing materials. Pick a leather-like material if you want to emphasise the sporty gaming look of your space. The leather-like material is easy to maintain and wipe clean. A mesh chair will encourage more air circulation and keep you cooler in hot climates. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <h5>
                  The ultimate gaming desk
            </h5>
            <p>
                  Gaming requires more equipment than your standard office PC. Gaming desks should be spacious and deep. Choose a gaming desk with enough room for your equipment. The desk depth helps place the monitor at a healthy distance away from your eyes. Choose a gaming desk that is large enough to accommodate your monitor or TV screen. Our gaming desks feature a contoured tabletop that supports your wrists and forearms. High side panels block sunlight to prevent glare on your gaming screens. Cup holders keep your snacks and beverages handy when you need to refuel while playing. Cable management solutions are essential for tangle-free and tidy cables. Pegs or drawers to store headphones and charging cables are also necessary to keep these items handy but out of the way.</p>
